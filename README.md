# Analysis of air quality 
1) Research question:  what is the group trying to learn or question to answer? Who is interested (audience)?

We are trying to learn how learn about the air quality across United states based on the historical date and determine the factors affecting it .This analysis can provide insight on which areas are affected most by air pollution and such analysis can help Environmental Protection Agency to take appropriate action to control the pollution.

2)  Domain and Data: 
Domain:Climate and Health care

Data source: Historical Air Quality

      a)  preprocessing that may be necessary (careful here)
      Most of the data is almost cleaned as it is almost clean as we are using data from google public datasets

      b)  size of data - data must be “big” data (millions of records)
            Its a Big data from google public datasets

      c)  tentative plan for analysis on GCP

           1)  EDA and Preprocessing
            we will check if we need any transformation or conversion of data and plot various graphs and plots to analyze the
            data.
           2)  Dashboard for User group, Dashboard for Data Engineers
               we will create a dashboard to visualize the outcome of our analysis
           3)  GCP further processing - ML
             We will try to predict the  air quality based on the historic  

           4)  Evaluation of results
             We will test the model with testing dataset and find the accuracy of the model 
           5)  Steps for production model

           6)  Final Dashboard for User Group
